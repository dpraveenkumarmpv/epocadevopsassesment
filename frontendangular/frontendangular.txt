Steps to deploy a Angular JS FE application,

# Login into the deployment server with the respective user that has permissions to deploy.

ssh username@<server-name>

# Clone the Git repository from the desired directory(Based on method followed either https/synced keys)

git clone <https url of the git repo> or git clone git@<url of repo>

# Get into the cloned directory

Install the project dependencies using npm 

Update the baseUrl in src/environments/environment.<en>.ts (Depending on the environment replace the en value accordingly)

For aws it would always be /api, Run

npx ng build --en(Depending on the environment replace the en value accordingly) in root of the project to build

If you have updated the baseUrl to /api for AWS run

aws s3 sync dist s3://BUCKET_NAME --delete

Once deployment is done, you can inform the respected FE team/testing team to validate the deployment.
